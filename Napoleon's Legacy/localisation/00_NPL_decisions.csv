arming_the_yugoslavs_desc;In our war with Austria, we have discovered that many of the minorities of the Empire desire independence, and some of the most desirous are the various South Slavic peoples. If we promise them independence, they will likely fight alongside our armies, making Austria's defeat all the more likely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

annex_the_fed_title;The Rheinbund Incorporation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
annex_the_fed_desc;After holding the office of the Presidency of the Rheinbund for more than twenty years, many in our government are beginning to feel we should use our position of influence to formally annex the Federation directly into the Kingdom of Prussia. Due to France's distraction with a civil war, it is unlikely that this move will be challenged, but it will surely be seen as an amoral one, both inside and outside Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
send_Frankfurt_delegate_title;Send a Delegate to Frankfurt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
send_Frankfurt_delegate_desc;The current assembly meeting in Frankfurt to discuss a unification of the German people is, for the moment, seen quite positively by much of our population. If we send a delegate in favor of unification to Frankfurt, we can calm them down from their current agitated state, but if the Assembly actually decides to unify, then we will be forced to cede sovereignty to the new union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

take_in_war_CAN_desc;We find ourselves at wat this day with the usurpers on the home islands. While it is unlikely this will be the final battle that decides the fate of the British race, if we do manage to pull off a complete victory in this war, we can forcibly annex the Union and establish ourselves as masters of the British nation once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

the_final_battle_BRI_desc;Our infiltration of the crumbling and decadent British Empire has paid off, and the country is completely divided. Our supporters stand ready to seize military and civilian headquarters all over their colonies and major cities, including the capital itself. As soon as we give the signal, the final battle that will reunite the British people will begin with a devastating first blow from us. The war will continue until one side reaches 100 War Exhaustion or completely conquers the other side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BRI_wins_modifier_title;Infiltrate the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRI_wins_modifier_desc;Due to our victories against the exiled monarchy for influence over the decades, many within the British Empire's government and military hierarchy have realized that the Union will inevitably reunite the British dominions. As such, now is the time to begin funding the creation of a fifth column within the Empire so that when the instability grows high enough that our spies tell us the right time to strike is here, our first strike will be devastating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

british_claim_on_ireland_title;Protecting our People;;;;;;;;;;;;;
british_claim_on_ireland_desc;Since we lost Ireland in the War of the Sixth Coalition, politics there have been dominated by the dictatorial Catholic Party, who refuse to allow the people any real say in the government and who brutally oppress the British and Protestant residents of the Island. While we have no desire to hold Ireland like the corrupt Hanoverians did, it might be necessary to intervene in Ireland for the sake of securing our bretheren's safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
royal_treaty_of_dublin_title;Royal Overtures;;;;;;;;;;;;;
royal_treaty_of_dublin_desc;Our spies in Ireland have recently reported to us that the government is in an uproar over a planned expedition by the Unionists to seize Northern Ireland. While we have always held onto our claim to all of Ireland, perhaps now is a good time to mollify our claims. If we offer them an alliance and a dropping of claims on their island in exchange for a recognition of Queen Victoria as their rightful sovereign and a port in Ireland for our navy, perhaps they will be willing to accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
treaty_of_dublin_title;The Irish Compromise;;;;;;;;;;;;;
treaty_of_dublin_desc;Now that we turned down the offer of protection from the British Empire, little stands between us and the military might of the Union. If, however, we were willing to send a delegation to London to at least hear what their government wants from us, without promising anything for now, perhaps we could mollify their wrath and seek better relations with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

embrace_ruthenians_title;Embrace the Ruthenians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
embrace_ruthenians_desc;Ruthenians compose a large plurality of the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth and a majority in the historical eastern border of the commonwealth. For decades, the Ruthenian culture and language has been slowly, yet surely, gravitating towards the Polish and Lithuanian ways of life to the point that Ruthenian is mutually intelligible with the two dominant languages of the commonwealth. The Ruthenians can, and have, fit well into the Polish-Lithuanian mold. The Ruthenian people are fine to join the national fraternity of the Polish and Lithuanian cultures as their own member in the commonwealth, for the stability of the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

the_british_cession_desc;Our border west of the Northwest Territories is one that is a point of tension with our neighbor. It remains ill-defined and uncertain, especially along the frontier areas. If we agree to establish the border as the 49th parallel, we will improve our standing in the eyes of the world along with our relations with our neighbor, though we will have to give up a small amount of land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

reino_unido_constitution_desc;The joint kingdoms of Brazil and Portugal have been plagued with issues concerning the economic and political interests of each. However, new economic and social theories are revealing to the populace that much can be gained for both sides in a fair and equitable union. Through the union, their lives had been improved by far much more than it would have been had they been separate. By holding a Congress with representatives from both kingdoms, a new constitution can be drafted to more firmly guarantee the life of the United Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
guyana_purchase_title;The Guyana Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;;
guyana_purchase_desc;Since our seizure of Guyana during the wars with Napoleon, we have owned only the eastern portion. The rest having been seized by the British has been in our eyes, an appropriate reaction. But with the Empire's lack of action in Europe and split empire abroad, we believe that we can make an offer to purchase the rest of Guyana and ease off the amount of land that is spread afar. However, if negotiations do not go our way, we are likely to claim the land forcefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
end_the_mysore_monarchy_title;End the Mysore Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
end_the_mysore_monarchy_desc;The Mysore monarchy has always been under our influence and compliant with our demands. The monarchy has recenty defied us by coronating a leader who will attempt to westernize his country and force us out of the Indian Sub-Continent. We must act and annex Mysore before we risk losing our control over Southern India;;;;;;;;;;;;;
end_EIC_title;End of the East India Company;;;;;;;;;;;;;
end_EIC_desc;This is only for AI, there is no need for a description. If you're looking at this and want to know the purpose, it's for when the EIC is a puppet of the British Empire and at war with Bengal. This is so the war isn't all messy because the idiots who programmed this game messed up puppet actions with their overlord and others. If you want an example, look at the Oregon Treaty events where it's incredibly difficult to make the Hudson's Bay Company secede land to the USA, instead you need to cede it to the Empire, and then the USA with any odd actions breaking it;;;;;;;;;;;;;

release_AFA_title;The Declaration of Free Peoples;;;;;;;;;;;;;
release_AFA_desc;During the French Revolutionary Wars and continued under Napoleon I, France expanded its borders all the way to Denmark in the North, the Rhine in the East, and Lombardy in the South. Few of the non-French peoples added to the Empire, however, were content with this, and currents of nationalism quickly formed. With the Civil War growing desperate, perhaps now is the time to take advantage of these sentiments by promising these peoples independence if they rise up against our enemy. Doing so, however, will mean forever abandoning our claims on their land when the war is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
a_new_concordat_title;A New Concordat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
a_new_concordat_desc;In 1801, after more than 10 years of strife between the Roman Catholic Church and France, First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte and Pope Pius VII reached a famous agreement that led to a reconciliation between church and state. The Concordat of 1801 gave the French Republic de facto control over the appointment of church officials in exchange for nominal church authority and a restoration of religious holidays. The agreement was an amazing political coup by Napoleon, who gained the support of France's Catholic population while keeping most of the power over the Church that had been set up in the 1790 Civil Constitution of the Clergy. However, a recent movement within the Church believes that it is now time that this deal be re-negotiated to ensure a better position for the Church in France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
french_invasion_title;Partant Pour la Egypte;;;;;;;;;;;;;
french_invasion_desc;In 1798, General Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt in a mission to establish a French protectorate there. The mission was intended to be the first step towards an eventual invasion of British India, but was also a personal project of Napoleon to research Egypt's history and culture. The scientists he brought to that ancient land started the craze for all things Egyptian that swept Europe in the 19th century, and made such discoveries as the Rosetta Stone and the former location of the ancient Suez Canal. While the mission eventaully failed due to British and Ottoman Intervention, recent nostalgia for the days of glory and empire have led many in our country to believe we should try and establish ourselves in Egypt once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
carribean_treaty_title;The Imperial-French Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
carribean_treaty_desc;In the Napoleonic Wars the British Empire, with its unquestionably superior naval power, seized all of the French colonies in the Atlantic, including ones that France had been given in other treaties or had owned for centuries. If we wish to attempt to find a solution to their claims to their colonies, let us call for negotiations between our two empires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
annex_algiers_title;Annex Algeria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
annex_algiers_desc;Since we thwarted Spanish ambitions there with the aid of the Barbary Corsairs in 1516, the Ottoman Empire has nominally ruled Algeria. Though how much control we have been able to exercise has varied throughout the centuries, our nation's current strength, bolstered by new military technologies that put us leagues ahead of them, will now allow us to rule Algeria more directly than ever before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vassalize_crimea_title;Vassalize Crimea;;;;;;;;;;;;;

crimean_war_title;The Crimean War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
crimean_war_desc;The Ottoman Empire used to directly rule or control much of the land surrounding the Eastern and Northern Black Sea, including the Crimean Penninsula, which was ruled by our vassals. While we lost these lands to the Russians long ago, the strife in Russia makes it possible that we could take much of this land back. While our claims will be shaky, the questionable legitimacy of the current Russian government and our historical justifications will least enable us to make a somewhat valid claim, though we may have to fear the intervention of Russia's allies. Further, if we fail to free the Crimea, no matter what else we accomplish, it is likely we will lose our claims to these lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
liberty_enlightening_the_world_title;Reminding The World;;;;;;;;;;;;;
liberty_enlightening_the_world_desc;It has been more than 40 years since France, under Emperor Napoleon I, came to the aid of the brave Polish people at the hour of their most dire need. Since then, the Kingdom of Poland-Lithuania has served as an inspiration to the romanticists in both of our nations, and has stood as a clear and voiceful reminder to the world of the lasting friendship that exists between the two nations. Some within France have suggested that we celebrate this anniversary by presenting to the Polish people a suitable gift to mark their time as a reborn nation, and their historical bonds of friendship with the French Empire. Vive la comm幦oration!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Neue_Ostpolitik_title;Enact the Neue Ostpolitik;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Neue_Ostpolitik_desc;An evolution of the Teutonic ideals that inspired the creation of our nation has begun to merit serious consideration by many in our government. Increasingly, influential figures are arguing that the Teutonic Empire has a duty to spread beyond its current borders and secure greater amounts of arable land so as to keep the German blood and spirit pure. Those who think this way are calling for a great crusade against the Slavs to the East, hoping to form a greatly expanded Teutonic State. Even the Head of State is not immune from such thoughts, though his government knows that to enact such a plan would meet with a great deal of enmity from the rest of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
appoint_slavophiles_title;Favor the Slavophiles;;;;;;;;;;;;;
appoint_slavophiles_desc;As head of state, let us choose, for the time being, to support the Slavophile faction. Their pro-peasant rhetoric might be crude, but it is appealing to the common people, and should reduce the risk of uprisings against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
appoint_westernizers_title;Favor the Westernizers;;;;;;;;;;;;;
appoint_westernizers_desc;As head of state, let us choose, for the time being, to support the Westernizer faction. Their liberal rhetoric might be tiresome, but it is should help soothe the eagerness of radical reforms and prevent people from developing dangerous ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
accept_estonians_title;Accept Estonians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
accept_estonians_desc;The Estonian people have long had a complicated relationships with the German nobility of the Baltic. They have typically been treated equally as poorly as other Baltic peoples, forced to labor as serfs. However, they are not Slavs, and many of the German nobles admire their spirit and culture, claiming that Estonians are "Fifty Percent" German. Let us issue a decree affirming that Estonians, while not equal to Germans, are tolerated state subjects and entitled to the protection of the law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
blood_for_Danzig_title;Retake Danzig;;;;;;;;;;;;;
blood_for_Danzig_desc;Prussia gained the city of Danzig in the Second Parition of Poland in 1793, but lost it only thirteen years later in the War of the Fourth Coalition. Though it was left independent in the Congress of Dresden, Prussia has been in charge of administering the Free City since then. Now, more than a decae later, nearly all of the German citizens of the city are desirous to return to the Prussian nation. Now is the time to announce to the world our retaking of our lost city! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
blood_for_Pom_title;Dealing with Pomerania;;;;;;;;;;;;;
blood_for_Pom_desc;The Kingdom of Prussia has long desired Swedish Pomerania, and with the recent rise of German nationalism, it is getting more and more difficult to control the German population there. With the rising military power of the German states and our decline, many in our government are advising us to make an offer to Prussia to sell Pomerania in exchange for 40,000 pounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
become_Teutonic_state_title;Declare the Teutonic Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
become_Teutonic_state_desc;After years of struggle, all of the southern coast of the Baltic is united under Prussian rule. Like our ancestors, the Teutonic Knights of old, we are bringing German rule and culture to the backwards lands of the east. Now is the time to declare the birth of a new Teutonic Empire that shall forever serve as a bulwark against the barbaric Slavic race.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
blood_for_Pruss_Pol_title;The Posen Germans;;;;;;;;;;;;;
blood_for_Pruss_Pol_desc;From the Second Partition of Poland until the birth of the Duchy of Warsaw, the Kingdom of Prussia had control over the Posen region of Germany. The large amount of Germans living there do not forget how much better life was under us rather than the Poles, and most long for a return to Prussian rule. Our spies in the region and in the nearby province of Thorn tell us that the Germans would be quite willing to attempt an uprising agaisnt the Poles to join us, if we would support them. Of course, such an act would be a virtual declaration of war against Poland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
enact_ostpolitik_title;Enact Ostpolitik;;;;;;;;;;;;;
enact_ostpolitik_desc;Now that we have secured our position in regards to Germany, the way to the east lies open. Otto von Bismarck promises that under his policy of Ostpolitik, Prussia shall secure the southern shore of the Baltic for the Prussian state. Expansion into the east will increase the agrarian and financial power of the Junker military-aristocracy and enable the Kingdom to establish a secure and stable bulwark of conservativism and monarchism that shall never be seduced by liberal and pan-Germanic ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
pomeranian_voivodeship_title;The Pomeranian Voivodeship;;;;;;;;;;;;;
pomeranian_voivodeship_desc;After decades of oppression, the Polish people have reclaimed most of the Pomeranian coast for themselves. With the acquistion of western Prussia, Polish nationalists are calling for the renaming of the towns and cities to Polish names for the area. The Polonization process will begin by changing 'west Prussia' to 'Pomorskie.' Goodbye Danzig, hello Gdansk!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

reclamation_of_west_prussia_desc;With the German territory of West Prussia reclaimed from the foul Poles, it is obligatory to reintroduce proper German names to the regions administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
posen_est_deutsch_title;Posen Ist Deutsch;;;;;;;;;;;;;
posen_est_deutsch_desc;After the Treaty of Tilsit ended the War of the Fourth Coalition, the rightful German lands of Posen were unlawfully given to the devious Poles at the behest of French plotters seeking to weaken the German people and establish the petty Polish puppet state. For decades the innocent Germans lived at the behest of cruel Slavic tyranny who tried to purge the German heritage of the region, but no more! Now Posen is back in German hands, and so it deserves German names once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
poznan_jest_polska_title;Poznan Jest Polska;;;;;;;;;;;;;
poznan_jest_polska_desc;The Germans may have forcefully taken Poznan from the Poles once again, but it is only temporary. Now Poznan back under its rightful owners once more! All that there is left to do is remove the stains of German influence in the names of the region, and the Polish state shall be even more united.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
warmian_masurian_voivodeship_title;The Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship;;;;;;;;;;;;;
warmian_masurian_voivodeship_desc;It has been centuries since the Duchy of Prussia was a vassal of the Great Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, yet many Poles speak fondly of a time when Prussia was obedient to the whims of Warsaw, and not the other way around, a time that many say is returning. The Slav minorities in East Prussia are flocking to our banners, and the cowardly German citizens whimper within their beloved Konigsberg as the flag of Poland is draped over the cities buildings. Semi-officially, many Polish soldiers are looting the ancient German buildings in Konigsberg, with Polish names being scrawled upon German signs and buildings. Officials within our government are viewing this news with pleasure, and wish to seek a full endorsement of the Polonization of Eastern Prussia. Now is the time to pay the Germans back for the indigities our people were forced to suffer for so long, now is the time to stamp our mark on the Germanic Hordes. Zwyciestwo Polski!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
drang_nach_osten_lithuania_title;Drang Nach Osten - Lithuania;;;;;;;;;;;;;
drang_nach_osten_lithuania_desc;We have gained parts of the ancient Teutonic lands on the Baltic coast, the region of Lithuania. Now that our military has marched to east to conquer the pathetic Baltic peoples, it is now time for our the citizens of Prussia to march east as well, to plant and cultivate the German seed over the Baltic provinces. To start this spread of German culture, we shall rename the cities and townships of 'Litauen' into proper German names.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
drang_nach_osten_latvia_title;Drang Nach Osten - Latvia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
drang_nach_osten_latvia_desc;Prussia marches on the east, as yet another area of the Baltic coastline belongs to our Teutonic Empire now. The Prussian eagle is now displayed across the streets of Riga, and the German nobility in Latvia is greeting the sounds of Prussian troops marching through the streets with glee. To both accomdate the existing German populace, and the new settlers in the area, now would be a good time to reclassify the region. 'Lettland welcomes all Deutschesvolk!' shall be a sign all German settlers will see as they make new lives here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
drang_nach_osten_estonia_title;Drang Nach Osten - Estonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
drang_nach_osten_estonia_desc;At last, the destiny of the Prussian people has been accomplish, and the entire Baltic coastline is now draped beneath a Prussian flag.

latvian_freedom_title;Freedom for Latvia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
latvian_freedom_desc;At last, the Latvia is a strong, independent nation, ready to choose its own path. Let us start off a new era of peace and prosperity for our people by throwing off the last shackles left of foreign oppression, and show the true spirit of Latvia to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
estonia_freedom_title;Freedom for Estonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
estonia_freedom_desc;The Russians and Germans both thought they could subdue the freedom of the Estonian people forever, and today we prove them wrong! By throwing off foreign names, and establishing a true Estonian state, the national unity of our people will soar as a result!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
thorn_is_ours_title;Claim Thorn;;;;;;;;;;;;;

lower_silesia_is_polish_desc;The lower Silesian region is now in Polish hands, and the Polish minorities in the region cry out in joy as our armies march through the land.

lower_silesia_reclaimed_title;Lower Silesia Reclaimed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lower_silesia_reclaimed_desc;It is a travesty that the Slavic hordes were allowed to trespass as far into German lands as they did, but now is the time to correct that horrible mistake by removing the imposed Polish names from the region. Breslau, you're coming home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
sell_surplus_title;Selling Supplies;;;;;;;;;;;;;
sell_surplus_desc;Due to the greatly reduced trade we have had with the British Isles since the 1820s, we find we have a severe military and industrial surplus at the end of each year. Though it is officially prohibited by the Empire, our policy has been to sell this surplus to the Indian states, who are always willing to pay huge amounts for it. Shall we continue the practice this year?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
missing_mughals_title;The Great Indian Kidnapping;;;;;;;;;;;;;
missing_mughals_desc;From the early 30s onwards, the tiny states of central India have been considered the top interests of both Hyderabad and the Mughal Empire. Recently, radical ministers in our cabinet have proposed bringing the matter to a head. If we hire some thugs to kidnap the Mughal ambassadors to these courts, we stand a good chance of forcing them to become our puppets. Of course, the Mughals might not back down, and we might face a war if we do this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
hold_Indian_congress_title;The Pan-Indian Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
hold_Indian_congress_desc;In the decades since the rebellion of the 1820s, the states of India have grown strong through their rapid modernization. Yep threats remain both from within and without. The sheer disorder of the multiple states of the subcontinent could easily kindle a great war, and greedy European powers are still lurking just across the ocean. Because of our pre-eminence in India, we have decided to call a Congress of all the Indian states in an attempt to bring the nations of India in a closer political union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
form_EIC_india_title;Form India;;;;;;;;;;;;;
form_EIC_india_desc;Though the ruling class of our nation is largely British, the fact that we allow natives a large share in the government has given many liberal Indians hope for the future. Some even advocate creating a united India under our liberal rule as a counterbalance to the despotism of the other Indian states. If we extend our influence over the subcontinent, we might be able to accomplish this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
indie_EIC_title;Independence for East India;;;;;;;;;;;;;
indie_EIC_desc;Our Company... no, our nation, has proved its strength. On our own, we have stood against enemies from without and within, and even with the Imperial leeches bleeding us dry, we have managed to create a stable and prosperous state. Many of our top officials now argue that it is high time we tell the bastards in Canada that they no longer have any right to control us. True, it may mean war, but we are confident that we can defeat anything the Empire throws at us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peacefully_federate_title;Centralizing the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peacefully_federate_desc;While forming an Indian Confederation was a tremendous achievement, some in our government claim it does not go far enough. Without a common economic and administrative policy, they argue, India is doomed to forever remain at the mercy of the West. As such, they advocate a radical move: announcing a centralized Indian Federation and stripping the states of their autonomy. While this would greatly strengthen the state, it is sure to cause tremendous disorder, and many states will likely resort to force of arms to resist us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

form_federation_desc;After the momentous reunifcation or our divided people, many in our nation are calling upon us to recognize this event by establishing a new order that will bring together the partisans of the Union and the Empire and will ensure stability and properity for all places where our nation touches. Many believe that the perfect symbol of a peaceful Britain would be the extension of rights to many of the races that live under our rule, as new ideologies about Britain's mission to civlize the world, combined with the technological wonders shrinking the size of the earth every day, have led many to believe that an Imperial Federation where all people are treated equally and share a common goal must be our nation's future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

enact_dual_monarchy_desc;The Nobles of the Hungarian Estates have, for some time, been pushing for increased independence for the Hungarian people and the Crown of St. Stephen. A proposal for compromise has now been drafted, under which the Kingdom of Hungary and the Empire of Austria will amalgamate into a new political entity: The Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy. Gott erhalte, Gott beschze!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
enact_dual_monarchy2_title;The Third Crown;;;;;;;;;;;;;
enact_dual_monarchy2_desc;The Slavic peoples in the south of our Empire, specifically the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes, have, for some time, been pushing for increased independence for their peoples. Rising nationalism and terroristic organizations forming amongst them have convinced many within our government that a third crown should be added to the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy, granting the Kingdom of the South Slavs the same autonomy Hungary enjoys in order to secure their loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

empire_absorbs_union_desc;Our once disloyal subjects on the British Isles have re-embraced the principles of monarchy at long last. While opinion is divided as to who their new monarch should be, the throne currently being occupied by a regent, our spies tell us many are pushing for the House of Hanover to be made sovereign once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

union_absorbs_empire_desc;Our brothers in the former British colonies have at long last overthrown the corrupt monarchy and embraced the principles of democracy. While opinion in the new republic is divided as to whether they should remain independent or rejoin our nation, our spies tell us many are pushing for the absorption by the British Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
roman_school_title;The Roman School;;;;;;;;;;;;;
roman_school_desc;Since immersing themselves in Western culture, studies of Western history have proven to be very popular amongst our people. Specifically, admiration for and study of the Roman Empire has proven to be influential enough that many in our nation are combining Roman architecture with our native styles, emulating Roman forms of dress, and even using Roman history to shape their political ideologies-- some deluded souls are even convincing themselves that our people have Roman ancestory due to a group of Roman explorers that found the New World and bred with our ancestors. Regardless of their silly beliefs, we can put this love of learning to good use by founding a national university dedicated to the study of Western classical culture and history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tribal_parliament_title;The Tribal Parliament;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tribal_parliament_desc;Now that we have launched upon a course of Westernization, many in our nation believe we should emulate Western forms of government by creating a national legislature. This institution would be similar to the British parliament, though it would also combine elements of the American Congress to ensure all tribes in our nation have significant representation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
indian_pendence_title;A Declaration of Equality;;;;;;;;;;;;;
indian_pendence_desc;For centuries, the native tribes of the Americas have been looked down upon by whites as barbaric and savage beasts, with some even claiming we lack souls. While this was never true, the technological divide between us and the West provided the impetus for this mode of thinking. Now that we have achieved a level of technological equivalence with the west, however, we can announce to the world that we are no longer pawns in the game of diplomacy, but a nation with equal rights and strength as others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
invite_natives_title;A Common Home;;;;;;;;;;;;;
invite_natives_desc;The Native Confederation was founded at the end of the War of 1812 as a buffer state to protect the British Empire's Canadian Dominion from the ambitious United States of America. While the nation was established with the nominal purpose of providing natives with a place to live in peace, few took this seriously, and only the natives who lived in the area became common citizens. However, now that the United States has begun agressively persecuting our bretheren, we might be able to convince many of them to settle here if we have the bureaucracy and capital to handle a mass immigration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

become_peru_title;A Peruvian Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;
become_peru_desc;As the years go by and our chances of regaining Spain and putting a king back on our throne grow ever dimmer, many in the former viceroyalty of Peru are beginning to question exactly what the destiny of our nation is. Calls for an abandonment of the Old World and an embracing of the new Peruvian order grow ever louder, as do calls for a truly representative republic instead of a restoration of the monarchy. If we so wish, we can formally abandon our claim to Spain and become a new nation: the Republic of Peru.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
spanish_resto_title;The Claim to Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;
spanish_resto_desc;When Napoleon invaded Spain and put his brother on the throne, few accepted him as the legitimate king. However, the true heir and his family were kept imprisoned by Napoleon until they died childless. As a result, the closest living relative happens to be the King of Sicily, due to a claim from Charles III of Spain. As our king is now the heir to the Spanish throne, we can send a delegation to the Cubano Cortes to make our claim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

By achieving a dominant position among the Rhine states, we can form the Rheinbund.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

travancore_eic_conflict_desc;In order to truly gain access to the Western land of India, we must control the tip of the Subcontinent which can become a great port for our navy to invade the west.

With the Mexican occupation of the Louisiana territory, American control of the land was effectively removed. If the war is lost by the Americans, their attempt at a land grab in Mexico will bite back hard with the loss of the entire Louisiana territory. The United States would be effectively without more than half of its land including multiple states, all lost to Mexico.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
