EVTDESC600050;When a Polish insurrection broke out in Galicia (Austrian Poland) and Krakow early in 1846 many Austrians held that Krakow's independent status provided the stimulus as well as a forum for the planning of Polish revolts.

EVTDESC600066;Giuseppe Garibaldi moved in with his wife and has been living in Montevideo for a time already. A sworn fighter against tyranny, he now has offered his help in setting up the defences of Montevideo against Oribe and Rosas and has offered to lead an Italian Legion made of foreign soldiers that will help us in the struggle against the tyranny of Rosas. Furthermore, it has been recommended that we do as the Blancos are planning to do and abolish slavery in Uruguay so we can have more soldiers for the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME700000;Death of Francia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC700000;Paraguayan supreme dictator, José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, took several precautions against assassination. He would lock the Palace doors himself, unroll the cigars his sister made to ensure there was no poison, prepare his own yerba mate, and sleep with a pistol under his pillow. No one could come within six paces of him, or even bear a cane near him. Whenever he would go out riding, he had all bushes and trees along the route uprooted so that assassins could not hide. All shutters had to be closed, and pedestrians had to prostrate before him as he passed. Sensing his mortality, he destroyed all his papers and refused medical aid, even lashing out at a physician with his sabre. In this day, Francia breathed his last and passed away. Francia left the state treasury with at least twice as much money in it as when he took office, including 36,500 pesos of his unspent salary, the equivalent of several years' pay. His daughter later burnt all his furniture after his death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME700001;The Rise of Carlos Lopéz;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC700001;Carlos Antonio López Ynsfrán, nephew of Francia, attracted the hostility of the dictator and uncle and he was forced to keep in hiding for several years. He was briefly secretary of the military junta that ruled the country after Francia's death and today, after years of confusion and chaos since Francia's death, he was chosen as the country's first consul--a post equivalent to that of president -- ruling alongside Mariano Roque Alonso.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME700002;Carlos López Takes Power;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC700002;Paraguay's Consul, Carlos López, exiled Roque and assumed dictatorial powers. The Congress approved the first Paraguayan Constitution — probably the work of Lopez himself. A few months later, Congress changed his post from consul to president, and elected him to the new post for a 10-year term. The constitution not only legally sanctioned López' dictatorial powers, but included no guarantees of civil rights. Indeed, the word "liberty" was not even mentioned in the text.\nHis government now is directing energy towards developing the material resources and strengthening the military power of the country. One of his first actions was to strengthen Paraguay's grip on the Chaco region by building forts and founding villages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME700003;Foreign Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC700003;López lead an extremely aggressive foreign policy which frequently caused attrition with other governments. In 1853, he refused to ratify a commercial and navigational treaty with the United States and began confiscating the property of American citizens residing in Paraguay. Because of a dispute with Britain, López closed Paraguayan waters to foreign warships. Today, Paraguayan soldiers fired upon an American ship engaged in a scientific survey of the Parana River, killing one American crew member.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC700004;Some years ago, the American ship USS Water Witch was doing a scientific expedition on the Paraná River when Paraguayan troops fired against it. This act of aggression wasn't met by an official apology by Paraguayan dictator Carlos López. This insult went unanswered for too long.

After the proclamation of the Paraguayan Republic he became an important political leader in South America, and was eventually installed as supreme leader before being declared dictator for life. \n Inspired by French revolutionary ideals, Francia sought to create a utopian state based on Rosseau's Social Contract. Although he strived for equality of the people, Francia ruthlessly destroyed any opposition and created a Police state, imprisoning all those he deemed seditious. \n Francia lived a spartan lifestyle, and apart from some books and furniture, his only possessions were a tobacco case and a pewter confectionery box.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME500000;The Organic Statute of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC500000;The Organic Statute of the Kingdom of Poland was a Statute which replaced the Constitution of 1815 in the aftermath of the failed November Uprising in the Russian Partition. The Statute was pronounced in occupied Warsaw on March 1832 by Marshal Ivan Fyodorovich Paskevich, who named himself a namestnik. The Statute, signed by Emperor Nicholas I of Russia, replaced the personal union between the Kingdom of Poland and the Russian Empire with the "eternal incorporation" of Poland into Russia. The Parliament of the Kingdom was abolished, and its army merged with the Russian Army. \n §RNOTE: Congress Poland is an extremely hard to play substate. You won't get any soldiers and when the Polish Uprising begins you will probably lose the game.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME500001;The Polish Uprising of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC500001;After the latest war our subjects in Poland and other parts of our empire began to grow restless.

In Warsaw alone 116 demonstrations were held in $YEAR$. Much of these manifestations in ended in clashes with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Army. In spite of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ police interference, a symbolic meeting of hymn-singing Poles and Lithuanians took place on the bridge across an important River. The crowds sang "God protect Poland" in Lithuanian and Belarusian. Earlier in $YEAR$ the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government introduced a state of emergency in Kovno and Grodno as well as several other Polish-majority provinces.

EVTNAME4661006;Bolivian-Argentine Border Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4661006;The border between Bolivia and Argentina has long been under influence of Caudillos from both countries, the provinces being raided and conquered numerous times.

After the recent war the Argentine took Cochinoca and Tarija, the latter being claimed by some Argentine northern Caudillos as being part of Argentina but that province long has been under the rule of Bolivia and has mainly a Bolivian population. Now with the post-war peace talks, our diplomats proposed that we raise the question of the settlement of the borders between Bolivia and Argentina.

EVTPDII50000;The Republican Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50000;The end of slavery had resulted in an explicit shift of support to republicanism by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic and social power in the country. To avert a republican backlash, the government adopted a series of credit and military policies and reforms to appease the land owners. The measures made by the government alarmed the civilian republicans and the Positivists in the military corps. They saw that it would undercut support for their own aims, and were emboldened to further action. For them, it had become a case of "now or never". Although there was no desire in Brazil among the majority of the population to change the form of government, the civilian republicans began pressuring the Positivist officers to overthrow the monarchy. The Positivists launched a coup d'etat and tried to institute a republic on $YEAR$. During the whole ordeal Pedro II showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the outcome.

vargastitle;The Rise of Getulio Vargas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vargasdesc;Vargas was born in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, into a family prominent in state politics. By 1922 he had risen rapidly in state politics and was elected to the National Congress, in which he served for four years. In 1926 Vargas became minister of finance in the Cabinet of President Washington Luís Pereira de Sousa, a post he retained until his election as governor of Rio Grande do Sul in 1928. From his position as state governor, Vargas campaigned unsuccessfully as reform candidate for the presidency of Brazil in 1930. While appearing to accept defeat, Vargas in October of that year led the revolution, organized by his friends, that overthrew the oligarchical republic. For the next 15 years Vargas assumed largely dictatorial powers, ruling most of that time without a congress. He held sole power as provisional president from Nov. 3, 1930, until July 17, 1934, when he was elected president by the constituent assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In 1899 General Cipriano Castro, a caudillo from the Andean state of Táchira, descended on Caracas with his provincial army and seized the presidency. As a result, five successive military strongmen from Táchira, known as Andinos, controlled the nation for the next 59 years, except for an interlude in 1945–48. The longest rule being the one of General Juan Vicente Gómez. Gómez was an effective, if ruthless, dictator. By manipulating elections, abolishing all organized political activity, and monopolizing appointive powers, he established a completely subservient legislative and judicial structure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
