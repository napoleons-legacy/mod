EVTNAME19500;The Eastern Frontier;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC19500;The British occupation is something most Afrikaners would prefer to forget about. With the British spread thin across the world, our settlers were mostly left to their own devices defending from the Bantu invaders. By the end of the Fifth Xhosa War of 1819, most of South Africa was controlled by Boer governorates and their provincial militias. Crippled by debt, the British government gave up their hold on Port Elizabeth and Cape Town and confirmed South African independence in exchange for a small sum of money and fleet basing rights. Rumours of gold, diamonds, and unlimited riches have led many to flee war-torn Europe for our republic. Some Boers have even decided to migrate further inland. On the other hand, overcrowding in Xhosa lands has culminated in yet another Frontier War-- the largest Bantu incursion into Afrikaner territory yet. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA19500;The only way is forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME19511;Zulu-Xhosa Conflict;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC19511;The Xhosa have been slowly creeping into our lands ever since they were defeated by the white men. Some Zulu chieftains have already decided to take matters into their own hands, severely punishing cattle raiders and other good-for-nothings. Perhaps now is the time to escalate?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA19511;They will tremble before our might!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB19511;Leave them be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME98210;South African Rule of Natal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98210;The Boers of Natalia are once again chafing under South African, resenting the idea that even though they left the Cape Colony they have not escaped the South African government. There have been several altercations with South African military forces, and the recommendation of the colonial government is that Natal be annexed before the situation grows worse. If we do not, then we must allow the Boers to find their own way -- and suffer the loss to our prestige this would entail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98210OPTA;We will annex the Natal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98210OPTB;Let them go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98211;Natalian Independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98211;After a series of altercations between South African colonial forces and the Boer militia, the South African government has decided to cut its losses and allow Natal its independence. Finally we will control our own destiny, away from South Africa now and forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98211OPTA;We will maintain good relations with the South Africans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98211OPTB;The Boer will find their own way -- without help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98212;The Annexation of Natalia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98212;After a series of altercations between South African colonial forces and the Boer militia, we have received a demand from the South African government that Natalia be annexed into the government. For all our struggles to leave the government behind, they yet follow us and refuse to allow us independence! So now we are faced with a choice: submit and move on, to find a place beyond their reach once more, or defy them and risk war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98212OPTA;We will not submit to South African rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98212OPTB;We have no choice. We cannot fight the South Africans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98213;The Boers Have Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98213;We have received word from the Natalian government defying our annexation. Now we must either go to war or stand down in humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98213OPTA;War it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98213OPTB;Natalia is not worth fighting over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME4661999;The Bolivian Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4661999;The Bolivian government has always been quiet and has ignored our wars with our puppets and neighbors, but with our recent conflicts and struggles, they have decided to declare independence for Bolivia. We can either not allow this to stand, or set them free.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4661999;We won't allow this injustice to happen!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4661999;If you love something, let it go.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662000;The Claims of Bolivia;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662000;Now that Bolivia ceases to exist, they can no longer contest the lands to the North actively. In their place we will claim the Northern lands they once did.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662000;We claim the Bolivian lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662001;Border Dispute With Gran Colombia;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662001;The Gran Colombians have once again shot at our borders in Costa Rica, but this time they have gone too far and have killed multiple border guards. We will not allow this to happen again, and the only way to stop this is through military action.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662001;We won't be seen as weak.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4662001;We can't risk war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662002;Panama is Ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662002;We have defeated the Gran Colombians and seized Panama for our country. The Colombians will now be more careful when deciding who's borders to fire upon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662002;We welcome the people of Panama into our republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662003;Our Claim to Pastaza;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662003;We have claimed Pastaza since our independence, and the time to regain lost land is now! We have a chance to bring down Gran Colombia and show our strength and ability to be a regional power;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662004;Spanish Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662004;We have defeated the Gran Colombians and shown them the strength of Spain. The terms for peace were the secession of Pastaza from Ecuador and the limiting of Colombia to build an army.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662004;Pastaza is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662005;Collapse of Gran Colombia;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662005;We are no longer able to lead Gran Colombia. Ecuador and Venezuela no longer have faith in our unity, having already left the federation. It is time to reinvent ourselves as Colombia. Maybe one day we can reignite the flame of Gran Colombia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662005;Viva Colombia!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662006;Unification of Gran Colombia;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662006;The Central Americans and Peruvians were not able to defeat Gran Colombia in their imperialist wars to kill the federation. Due to these wars, the respective governments of Ecuador and Venezuela have agreed to centralize the federation in hopes of strengthening our position in South America.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662006;The flame of Gran Colombia burns bright!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA99033;We accept those who come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662008;Liquidate the Hudson's Bay Company.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662008;The Hudson's Bay Company has finally declared bankruptcy, leaving us to seize their assets and fold their current posts into the British Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662008;They needed to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662009;A New Capital for Gran Colombia?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662009;We have federalized our country, and have decided to choose a new capital for our country. What we choose will be our new capital for the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662009;Bogota is the only candidate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4662009;Quito provides an ideal Pacific capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4662009;Caracas will make a great coastal capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662010;The Luccan Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662010;With the unification of Italy starting to gain speed, we have decided to choose the fate of Lucca, an Italian country under our control. We can either divide the country between the Papacy and the Kingdom of Italy with great boost to our relations and reputation, let the Luccans stay as they are, or annex them directly into the French Empire to make sure they try nothing suspicious;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662010;They should join their true family;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4662010;Lucca is fine as it is now;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4662010;Lucca is a member of the French Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662011;Brazil Claims Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662011;With the recent loss of Rio de Janeiro to rebels, the realization by the Brazilian people that they can finally gain independence has come to them, and have acted upon our temporary state of weakness. We can choose to destroy them and solidify our control over the region, or give them the independence they really want.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662011;We won't back down!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4662011;We will grant them independence, but we want Guyana.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4662011;They can have the entirety of the continent for themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662012;The Guyanese Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662012;Guyana has had an offer to be purchased for an amount of 50,000. This can certainly be used for our expansion back into Europe, or to promote a rebellion in the isles.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662012;We have no need for Guyana, we accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4662012;We can only afford to give half of our deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4662012;The territory of Guyana is rightful British land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662013;A Partial Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662013;The British have come back to us with a partial offer. We can choose to get half of the colony for only 25,000 with their reasoning being that they still need a gateway to defend their African colonies. We can choose to either accept, gain nothing, or take it by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662013;We accept this offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4662013;This offer is trash!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662014;Negotiations Crumble;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662014;The British have offered us nothing! Our offer was appropriate and should have gone through.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662014;There is nothing we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4662014;We will take this land by force!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662015;The Napoli Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662015;We have defeated the false claimants to the land of Naples. The pretenders being executed can no longer claim our land!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662015;Sicily is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662016;The Sicilian Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662016;We have defeated the false claimants to the land of Sicily. The pretenders being executed can no longer claim our land!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662016;Naples is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662017;The Orissan Court;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662017;Our meeting with the monarch of Orissa has gone terribly, with our ambassador mis-translating and insulting the family of their King. Attempts to correct this mistake have only made the problem worse with the Orissans now up in arms demanding the execution of our ambassador. The British Empire tells us to not give the ambassador, but we can choose to defy them and send back the ambassador.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662017;The ambassador is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4662017;The ambassador is theirs?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662018;The Second Battle of Vizagapatam;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662018;Our military advisors from the British Empire have told us to attack from behind our border. They promise us this can end the war instantly, and grant the possession of this new land. We can definitely trust them thanks to this having worked in the First Battle of Vizagapatam against the French Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662018;We will do as we're told.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4662018;We'll defy the British and negotiate peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662019;Treaty of Calcutta;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662019;Our victory against the weak willed Orissans have brought us great power in the negotiations table. We've been advised to keep Vizagapatam for our own in order to finally reclaim India.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662019;Vizagapatam is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4662019;Vizagapatam is theirs?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662020;Reclamation Westward?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662020;Our quest in reclaiming the lands of the Indian coast have been working so far, but if we are to control India, we will need to control the center of the Indian subcontinent. Our gateway into that land is through the small country of Bastar. Its negligable power is perfect for us to take advantage of. The only risk is upsetting the Hyderabadis, a large and powerful country in India.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662020;Onward to the west!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4662020;We shouldn't challenge the Hyderabadi dragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662021;East Indian Company;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662021;Our government in control of the East India Company has gained some land in India. It would be wise to give the East India Company that land in their struggle to reclaim the Indian subcontinent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662021;This is appropriate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662022;Establishing a Friendly Government;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662022;The East India Company before the collapse had always had princes under our government, but not under our direct control. Through them, we could enact policies where the prince gained benefit and we did too, but at the cost of the populace. We have decided to restart that trend again, but we have no idea who to choose first and we can only choose one in order to extract the most profits. Should we install a friendly government in Nagpur or Bundelkhand? They are medium sized countries so we'll have to cut them both down a bit in order to connect to Vizagapatam. With a good bribe, we can do this now!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662022;Bundelkhand is rich in food sources, they'll do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4662022;Nagpur is rich in dye, they're profitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4662022;We want to coexist with the Indian countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662023;Isolation of Orissa;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662023;Our growth into India has been contained into Eastern India, where we can administer land strongest. We are almost done in our conquest of Eastern India with the Kingdom of Orissa being the only country left. They are isolated politically, economically, and even socially. Even though they have the support of Hyderabad, it is only on paper. Now is the perfect chance to finish off Eastern India in the name of the East India Company!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662023;The Bay of Bengal is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662024;The East Indian Company Conflict;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662024;The East India company has been expanding rapidly in an odd fashion. They seem to be expanding around our country, slowly isolating it as if to form a choke hold on our country. Even our countrymen have noticed, with their cries to take action before the East India Company fully ensnares our country, bringing us down to their boots. We must take action now, or forever fight no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662024;They haven't done much, let's negotiate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4662024;They must be defeated by us!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4662024;Best to not anger the Company lion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662025;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Request;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662025;Apparently we have been expanding too quickly, having gained the attention of $FROMCOUNTRY$. Their diplomat said that the East India Company has been expanding around their country and slowly isolating them. Their only request is to create a buffer state under $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ surveillance. But the question is, why haven't they done anything to the French?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662025;Might as well listen?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4662025;They think we are weak!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME4662037;Redrawing the Subcontinent;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4662037;Our country's victory against her enemies has given us power to negotiate for the accomplishment of our desires. In order to further our ambitions as the sole hegemon of the subcontinent, we must act wisely as to not tarnish our legacy. Or we are not $COUNTRY$ men!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4662037;We will punish!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4662037;We will emancipate!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4662037;We will accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME86016;A Golden Opportunity;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86016;We have recieved shocking news this morning. Our provinces on the European continent, subjugated as they are by France, have today risen up and joined the raging French Civil War. One side in the war has promised our people their lands back if they assist them in their fight.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME86018;The Noble Question;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86018;Thought the old nobility was abolished during the French Revolution, Emperor Napoleon I created a new nobility during his reign in the hopes of stabilizing his dynasty. As they have far fewer priveleges than the nobility of the old Kingdom, they have been relatively uncontroversial until now. A new faction in the Upper House, however, calling themselves the socialists, have begun attacking the institution, saying it represents a violation of the principles of equality that France should pursue. Their words are proving quite effective amongst our people, and the issue is becoming one of the largest concerns for our nation.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86018;We shall have to think about this.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86019;The Debate Rages;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86019;The issue of the legitimacy of the Imperial nobility has taken over the political scene entirely. The socialists have proven very effective at spreading their message, and many people are now clamoring for an end to all noble offices, and some even for the abolition of the monarchy! At the same time, the nobility and its supporters have fought back, and are demanding that we guarantee their continued existence. Regardless of what we do, our actions shall have severe reprecussions.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86019;Nobility is a graceful ornament to the civil order.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB86019;Gradually eliminate the noble orders.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME86022;Republican Reaction;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86022;It seems that many socialists are no longer content with fighting the nobility, but now propose eliminating the monarchy itself.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86022;Let them try.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86023;Bourbon Beliefs;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86023;It seems that many reactionaries are no longer content with keeping the nobility, but now propose restoring the Bourbon dynasty to the throne.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86023;Let them try.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86024;An End to Empire?;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86024;The event we have feared has come: the socialists and their ilk have risen against us and declared themselves the legitimate government of France. With the goal of establishing a Republic and overthrowing the Bonaparte dynasty, many Frenchmen have rallied to their call. There are many bloody years ahead for France. Be warned, though: a White Peace will not satisfy the people. Attempting to do so will lead to violence quickly starting again, until one side has reached 100 war exhaustion.;;;;;;x;;;;;;x;;;;;

However, a group of socialists has come to us and proposed a deal. If we make significant political and economic concessions to them, they will call off their dogs. Doing so will greatly strengthen liberal elements in our nation and anger conservative ones, along with making us look weak, but refusing will mean Civil War.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME66649;The Union Intervention;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66649;Though we have generally pursued friendly relations with the British Union since our independence, one issue of contention between us has always been our treatment of the British and Protestant minorities within our borders. While we do our best to protect them, there are often many acts of violence committed against them by zealous Irish nationalists. Unfortunately, we have today recieved word that the Union no longer considers us to be doing an adequate job in protecting them, and is now claiming Northern Ireland as their own while preparing a military expedition to seize it from us.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66649;This is an outrage!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66650;Imperial Protection?;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66650;News of the recent claiming of North Ireland by the British Union has reached the ears of our former tyrannical masters in exile. They have offered us an alliance against the Union in exchange for the ceding of a port to them so that their military can be stationed in Ireland and a recognition by us of Victoria as our Queen. Though we would retain full autonomy in such an arrangement, many feel that this is an intrusion on our sovereignty and that an agreement with the Empire would be no better than a deal with the Devil. Rerusing their help, however, will mean we will have little between us and the Union's might.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66650;Their protection would be most welcome.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB66650;We make no deals with tyrants!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC66651;News has reached us that the oligarchic regime in Canada has attempted to take advatage of our recent dispute with Ireland by establishing a military base there and by forging an alliance with Ireland. It seems our attempt to establish ourselves there just got a bit more complicated.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66651;Drat.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC66654;Ireland has proven to be very disturbed by our recent actions in preparation for liberating the British population of Northern Ireland.

EVTNAME66655;Union Negotiations;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66655;While the British Union has proven willing to consider abandoning their claims on Northern Ireland, their price is somewhat high. They demand an end to the persecution of the British population and an opening of the government to Protestants, which would mean an end to the dominance of the Catholic party.

EVTNAME66660;Protecting our People;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66660;Since we lost Ireland in the War of the Sixth Coalition, politics there have been dominated by the dictatorial Catholic Party, who refuse to allow the people any real say in the government and who brutally oppress the British and Protestant residents of the Island. While we have no desire to hold Ireland like the corrupt Hanoverians did, the persecution has grown so intense that more than half our government has come to believe that it will be necessary to intervene in Ireland for the sake of securing our bretheren's safety.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME66600;The Chill Australian Wind;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66600;Since the British Revolution of 1825, the former penal-colony of Australia has been one of the most fiercely divided regions of the world. Half of the population is strongly pro-monarchy while the other half is strongly pro-Union, and there are almost no neutrals. Acts of violence against the other side are common, and more than one man has been killed by a brother who supported the other side. Recently, however, the situation has gotten much worse. It is likely that within about three months, Australia will break out into a full-blown civil war between Unionists and Monarchists. The amount of division of opinion about the monarchy will likely prevent us from directly employing forces to quell the coming war, but we can start attempting to ensure our supporters win right now through a propaganda campaign.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME66601;The Australian War;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66601;As feared, the colony of Australia has erupted into complete violence. Supporters of the British Union have taken up arms against supporters of the Empire, and cities all over the continent are declaring themselves for one side or the other. While some in our cabinet are pushing for us to immediately land troops to quell the fighting, and thus treat this as a colonial uprising, many of our ministers urge caution. There are many in our Empire who sympathize with the Union, and it is feared that an armed intervention, unless the Union makes the first move, will lead to an eruption of disloyal sentiment everywhere. Instead, if we wish, we can covertly support our supporters in Australia, though the Union will no doubt be doing the same. The war will end when one side either conquers the other or reaches 40 War Exhaustion.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME66616;The Scottish Question;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66616;Though Britain has been a unified nation consisting of the old Kingdoms of England and Scotland for over a hundred years, government policy towards Scotland changed significantly when the British Revolution of 1825 took place. Adopting the ruthlessly centralizing policies of the French Republic, the new Union government removed any remaining autonomy the Scots had and launched upon a policy of cultural unification, shutting down schools that taught the Scottish lanugage and attempting to destroy much of Scotland's heritage. As a result, many of the Scots have grown increasingly bitter against our republic and long for a return of the monarchy.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66616;They are not Scots, they are BRITONS.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66617;A Scottish Assembly?;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66617;Though the policy of cultural homogenization has had some effects in Scotland, there are still very large amounts of Scots who refuse to view themselves as British citizens. Some of the more moderately minded Scots, who support republicanism, have proposed a compromise by establishing a seperate parliament for Scotland that will give the Scots some autonomy. As this is totally repugnant to the centralization policies of our government, however, few of the MPs are willing to support this idea.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66617;They must submit to our rule.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66618;Scottish Home Rule?;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66618;The continued resistance of the Scots to accepting central rule has worn down the will of many of the more moderate Members of Parliament. In order to secure stability in the Union once and for all, and to better resist the monarchist influences amongst the Scottish radicals, the Moderates have today sumbitted a proposal to grant the Scots recognition as a region of the Union with some control over economic and religious matters. While the Union would still have much more power than the local assemblies of Scotland, the liberal parties of Parliament are completely opposed to the idea. If accepted, the proposal will appease the Scots, but the more radical republicans threaten to consider the current government illegitimate and a traitor to the principles of the Union if it goes through.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66618;We are one Union. The motion fails.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB66618;Damn the radicals. The motion passes.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66619;Influence in Scotland;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66619;The usurpers on the home island have today drawn a line in the sand for the oppressed Scottish population of the British Isles, informing them that they have no alternative but to accept cultural homogenization. This presents a golden opportunity for us, as many supporters of the House of Hanover still reside in Scotland. If we make a promise to them to recognize Scotland as a seperate kingdom under a common monarch once we retake the Isles, we stand a good chance at securing significant support amongst their population. Whether we will actually keep this promise, of course, remains to be seen.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66619;Scotland will be free if it fights for us.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

Thankfully, however, most of the military stayed loyal to our government, and the perpetrators are being rounded up and executed as we speak.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC66621;Today the radical republicans seized control of the government in a coup d'?at.

EVTOPTA66621;Disturbing, but not surprising.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66622;The Scottish Promise;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66622;Now that we have retaken the British Isles, our Scottish supporters are requesting that we fulfill our promise to release them as an autonomous nation under a personal union with us.

EVTDESC121220;The War of 1812 shattered the fledgling United States of America. In the year 1816, British troops marched through the streets of American cities as the USA lost battle after battle with them. At the Hartford Convention that year, the Federalist-supporting, anti-war states of the North voted to expel the Southern and Western states from the Union and make peace with the British. Though the South fought to keep the Union whole, with both the British and their Northern brothers to contend with, their efforts failed. Since then, the USA continues to exist in the North, while the remaining states, under the control of the powerful Southern landowners, abandoned the Constitution and re-adopted the Articles of Confederation, granting state and local governments far more power. Yet many in both nations hope that one day, the Union will be whole once more. With the issue of slavery, firmly supported in the CSA and completely opposed in the USA, rising to prominence recently, many see the increasing divide between the two nations as proof of a coming new war.,;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME121262;Believers and Pagans;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121262;A recent policy enacted by the British Empire allows for unlimited missionary operations within our borders. While this may be good for the souls of our wards, Hindu and Muslim intellectuals alike are both furiously protesting against the agressive tactics of the missionaries. Some are even beginning to call for a holy war to drive out Christians from India.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME121263;West in the East;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121263;In order to maximize profit, we have adopted policies of railroad building, increased taxation, large-scale farming, and the beginnings of industrialization in India. While all of these policies have aided the economic growth of our dominion, many of the natives are growing angry at their destabilizing force.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME121264;Whites and Browns;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121264;For most of the 18th century, the East India Company was relatively tolerant when it came to race. We allowed Indians to breed with our soldiers and for most of them to hold moderately high military and political offices. However, a new wave of white supremacy has taken hold of many within our government. Indians now find the way to higher positions barred, and are forced to serve in lowly ranks for little pay. This has been especially prevalent in the military, where many of the Indian troops are complaining of their unfair treatment. Some have even been arrested for making threatening statements towards their white officers.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME121265;The Indian Mutiny;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121265;Horrible news has reached us from the borders of our dominion. The dissatisfaction with our rule amongst the Bengali people has come to a head, and soldiers have begun mutinying en masse, massacring their officers and any Christians they can get find. Religious leaders are calling for holy war to drive us out of India and into the sea, and a groups of Hindu princes have announced their intentions to reclaim Bengal for Indian rulers. We must be prepared to fight to the deaths to save our position!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME121267;The Indian Mutiny;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121267;News has reached us from the lands of the East Indian Company of a vast mutiny of their colonial troops. White men, women, and children are being massacred, and native rulers have announced their intentions to drive the British out of India entirely. Because the Company simply cannout deal with the situation on their own, many believe we should formally announced the end of the East India Company and the incorporation of their lands directly into the British Empire.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121267;We must act quickly to save British India!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME121268;The East Indian Mutiny;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121268;The fools in the East India Company have announced today their intention to leave the British Empire and establish a seperate state. Letting them go cause a serious loss of revenue, but many fear that we might not be able to win a war against them.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC121269;Now that we are an independent nation, we must decide on the form of the government.

Some radicals have even proposed establishing a monarchy under the President of the Company, arguing that oriental despotism is the only form of government that can work in the East.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC121270;The form of the government is settled, but who should run it? The more conservative members of the cabinet argue that the natives must not be allowed a part in ruling at this time due to their uneducated state. The liberals, however, argue that Bengalis should be allowed to hold lower offices in the state.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC121274;The Mughal Emperor, Akbar Shah II, has passed away today. Though he preferred his son Mirza Jahangir to be his successor, the untimely death, rumored to be a poisoning, of this prince has led to the succession of the youngest son, Zafar, who has taken the name Bahdur Shah II. An athlete and a poet, the new Emperor is known for his extreme toleration of both Hindus and Muslims and his desire to preserve the throne of the Mughals at all costs.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME121278;The Pan-Indian Congress;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121278;On the urging of the strongest Indian state, it has been decided that a Congress of all the Indian nations should meet soon for the purpose of creating a closer political union to protect our lands from threats within and without. If we wish to hear exactly what will be discussed and influence the decision, we should send a delegate to the Congress.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTB121278;Sounds like a waste of time.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121279;An Indian Confederation?;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121279;The delegates have all arrived, and the discussion of India's future has begun. Two major views have quickly emerged as the possibilities for India. One is a more tame idea that the Indian states should merely promise to seek better relations and mutual protection in the future, an unenforcable idea. The other is that all of the states should unite under an Indian confederation led by the caller of the Congress. Though each state will retain its own autonomy in this arrangement, there will be a common foreign policy enforced as a result.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121279;We vote for Confederation!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB121279;The system as it works now is fine.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121280;The Birth of a Confederation;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121280;A majority of the Indian States have agreed that an Indian Confederation is the best means of ensuring stability and security on the subcontinent. As such, nearly all of the states are surrendering their sovereignty to us, and any that don't are rightly seen as legitimate targets of war to bring them into the new state. For the first time in a millenium, India is (somewhat) united under one master.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121280;It shall never be divided.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121281;The Birth of a Confederation;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121281;A majority of the Indian States have agreed that an Indian Confederation is the best means of ensuring stability and security on the subcontinent. As such, nearly all of the states are surrendering their sovereignty to the pre-eminent power. Though we could resist and refuse to join, there is a good chance that the new Indian Confederation would seek to bring us into the union by force.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121281;We'll join... for now.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB121281;We want no part of this!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121282;Leaving the Confederation;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121282;Though we willingly joined the Indian Confederation, our nation has recently undergone severe changes, and as such, has decided to leave.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121282;Good riddance!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121283;Leaving the Confederation;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121283;Though it willingly joined the Indian Confederation, one of the member states has recently declared its independence and left the union. This has produced a political crisis over the matter of whether a state of the Confederation should have the right to leave the Union. As such, we have two options. The first is to decide that no one may leave. If we do this, we will announce a new doctrine of Federation for the Union in which the autonomous states will be forcibly incorporated directly into the administrative structure, forming a federation. We would also declare war on the trespassing state. Otherwise, we could let the nation go and keep trying to preserve the current system.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121283;No one may leave! Federation forever!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB121283;Every state has a right to leave.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121284;The Doctrine of Federation;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121284;A new political system has been announced for India. Under this system, we will lose out autonomy and be directly incorporated into the Indian political structure. If we refuse to accept this, we will have to fight for our independence.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121284;Just give in.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB121284;We will never accept this! To war!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121285;The Treaty of Vancouver;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121285;Surprising the entire world, we have successfully defied the British Empire and defeated them in war.

EVTNAME121286;The Loss of Norway;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121286;Now that we have lost all of the provinces of Norway, we are faced with a difficult choice. The more peace-minded ministers in the government argue that we should drop all claims to Norway and be content with owning Denmark, while the more conservative members insist we must not drop our claims.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC121287;Now that we have lost all of the provinces of Lithuania, we are faced with a difficult choice.

EVTNAME121288;The Alaskan Purchase;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121288;Our colony in Alaska has never been anything more than a few stations for fur trappers. At best, it has made minor profits for us every few years or so. Today the Hudson's Bay Company has approached us and asked us to give it to them in exchange for 72,000 pounds. Shall we accept?;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121288;Alaska has been a burden.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC121313;Now that we have unified the states of the Confederation of the Rhine, we have come one step closer to uniting all of Germany. However, the Prussian Kingdom has sent a delegation to us today asking to discuss long-term plans for German unification. Prussian conservatives are of the opinion that our nation, united under a liberal banner, stand for all sorts of Godless and repugnant ideas, and they want no part of it. As such, they ask us to make an agreement with them in which they will abandon all claims on German lands if we will agree to never seek Prussian inclusion in an eventual unification of all of Germany. Accepting would certainly make forming a German state easier, but many argue that a German Union without Prussia is not really a union at all.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;

He urges us to set up a conference with the Federation to negotiate an arrangement in which Prussia will forever abandon claims on other German lands in exchange for the Federation promising not to pursue a union of Prussia with the rest of Germany. On the other hand, many liberals within the government oppose Bismarck, saying that Prussia's future still lies in the West as part of a German nation.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC121325;Since the success of the 1826 Decembrist Rebellion, a coalition of liberal-minded army officers have served as the major power faction in the Russian government. In recent years, however, there have been increasingly strained relations between two factions within the Decembrists- the Westernizers, who wish to see Russia become more like the nations of Europe, and the Slavophiles, who, while supporting democratic reform and improved living conditions for the peasantry, believe that Russia must not embrace Western ways, but must instead rely on its traditions and agrarian spirit to thrive. The divide has finally reached the boiling point, and the two groups have formally divided into opposing parties.

However, he had no male children, and in an effort to prevent the son of Nihcolas Romanov from inheriting the throne, his eldest surviving daughter, Catherine Mikhailovna, has taken the throne as Catherine II. This move has given the government even more questionable legitimacy, and many are now openly calling for a return of the ""legitimate"" Tsar in exile.";;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;

If we attack the rebels, we could likely aid the German people in their struggle.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37232;The German War of Liberation;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37232;Both sides in the French Civil War have agreed to release the oppressed Germans within the French Empire.

EVTDESC32400;On 26 December, 1825, a group of liberal army officers successfully overthrew the autocratic Tsar Nicholas I, replacing him with the constitutional Emperor Constantine I. Though the officers were inspired by the liberal principles of the French Revolution, they mainly succeeded due to the disgust of the more conservative officers with the tsars, whose conduct in the Napoleonic Wars they blamed for disgracing Russia. Now, more than ten years later, liberal government has largely failed to change the financial or military situation of the Russian Empire, and many are beginning to grumble for a return of divine and blessed autocracy. Constantine's death in 1831 and the subsequent placing on Grand Duke Michael on the throne further destablized the situation, and recent rumors of an ideological divide in the ruling Decembrist faction also serve as harbingers of the coming trials for Russia.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC32411;Attempts to compromise between the autocrats and the constitutionalists have failed. The forces of reaction have raised their flag under a tsarist pretender, and they are determined to restore the old ways by any means necessary. Russia now has a choice-- forward to an age of liberalism, or backwards into an age of superstition? We must now fight to defend the principles we hold dear, but be warned: A White Peace will not satisfy the people. Attempting to do so will lead to violence quickly starting again, until one side has reached 100 war exhaustion.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME32416;The People do not Accept the Peace;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32416;Some in our government thought that the best way to deal with the Civil War was to make a temporary peace with the enemey in order to lick our wounds and rebuild our armies. Unfortunately, our people do not agree, and our armies have begun to reattack the enemy.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32416;There shall be no peace until our nation is whole once more.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32461;A New Concordat;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32461;Since 1801, relations between the Roman Catholic Church and France have been based on the Concordat of 1801, which gave France a great deal of leverage in dealing with the Church within its borders. However, it now seems that a newly appointed Pope with reactionary ideas has demanded that we re-negotiate the Concordat to allow the Church more power. If we agree to negotiate, our population and the rest of the world will see us as weak. However, if we refuse to negotiate, we may face the Church's ill will and maybe even the excommunication of the Emperor.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32461;Perhaps we should be more fair to the Holy Father.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB32461;Does the Pope forget that we once annexed his realm?.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32462;Negotiations Begin;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32462;The wise Emperor of the French has seen the validity of our complaints, and has proven willing to negotiate a new concordat. This is the day that the Church once more begins to reclaim its place in the world as the one true church!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32462;God Bless the Emperor.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32463;Negotiations Refused;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32463;It seems that the godless Emperor of the French has refused to consider changing the terms of the Concordat. This leaves us with a dilemna: we can back down, and lose prestige in the eyes of the world and the faithful, or we can excommunicate the Emperor. This option is risky, however, as we risk angering France enough to cause a war.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32463;Perhaps we shall wait for another day to discuss this...;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB32463;The Church has but one head. Excommunicate him.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32464;The Pope Backs Down;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32464;Thankfully, cool heads have prevailed in our dispute with the Holy Father. He has agreed to continue accepting the terms of the Concordat of 1801.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32464;Even the devout can see Napoleon's wisdom.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32465;Excommunication;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32465;The fool that sits on St. Peter's throne has made a very unwise decision and has expelled our Emperor from the Church. While French priests will surely ignore the Pope's bluster, many in our nation are so offended by the actions of the Pope that they are calling for a re-annexation of the Papal States and French subjugation of the Pope, as Napoleon I did in 1808.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32465;Let us make the Pope just a Bishop of Rome!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB32465;War against the Pope seems a bit extreme.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32499;Union Tensions;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32499;When Napoleon invaded Portugal in 1808, the Royal court of Portugal fled to their colony of Brazil. Over the years spent in exile, Brazil was raised to the status of a co-equal Kingdom with Portugal and Rio de Janeiro became the new administrative and financial center of the Portuguese Empire. Even after Napoleon withdrew his troops from Iberia in 1813, the continuing tensions on the continent dissuaded the Royals from returning. Now that Portugal is largely secure, however, many of our subjects there feel that their interests are being sacrificed to the interests of Brazil and are pushing for the Court to return to Lisbon.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32499;We shall stay in the New World.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC40000;When First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte abandoned Haiti in 1804, he never forgot the humiliation his troops had suffered there. Even today, many feel that the time is right for us to take Haiti back as our rightful colony. The Haitians know this too, and so have offered us a large concession in exchange for us dropping our claims. If we accept, we lose our justification for taking the island back, but a refusal may reflect poorly on us in the eyes of the world.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA40000;We accept this offer.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME32490;The Return of Greek Nationalism;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32490;In the 1820s, the Greek subjects of our Empire began a massive rebellion against our rule. Thankfully, due to the weakened state of the Christian Powers, infighting amongst the rebels, and the aid of Egypt, we managed to crush the revolt. Yet now, a decade later, Hellenistic sentiments continue to bubble beneath the surface of the calm in Greece. We must face the fact that another Greek rebellion is likely quite soon.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32490;We shall survive this storm, too.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32489;Secret Societies;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32489;Resentment against Turkish rule has led to the emergence of organizations pushing for complete independence for Greece from our Empire.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32489;Barbarians.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32488;A Rising Greek Movement;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32488;Since the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the Greeks have labored under the rule of the despotic Turks. Yet in recent years they have begun to organize into circles dedicated to resisting the Ottomans and restoring their ancient nation. We have a chance to contribute to these movements, yet to do so would seriously damage our relationship with the Ottoman Empire. To not do so, however, would likely lead to resentment amongst our Hellenophilic classes.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32488;Fund these heroes!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB32488;We shall not aid those who contribute to disorder.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32487;Foreign Funding for the Greeks;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32487;It seems that we shall have to deal with more than the stubbornness of the Greeks in our efforts to retain our Empire's integrity. Disgustingly, the Greek Rebels are now receiving funding from Christian nations, increasing their effectiveness.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32487;I doubt they will ever be able to pay that money back.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32486;The Greek War for Independence;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32486;News has reached us that the Greeks have organized an effective rebellion against the Turks and declared independence from the Ottoman Empire. It is likely, however, that the Turks will not be long in crushing this rebellion. If we wish, we can establish diplomatic relations with the Greeks and interven in the war, though this would drastically hurt relations with the Ottomans. Our wealthier populace, however, seems eager to support the revival of Athens, and will not take a refusal to intervene very well.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32486;We owe much to the ancient Greeks. It is only fitting that we aid their descendants.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB32486;They're not even real Greeks, you idiots!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32485;Intervention in the Greek War;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32485;We have received terrible news. As if our fight with the Greek rebels has not been difficult enough, it seems that a Great Power has decided to intervene in an attempt to restore Greek independence. They have informed us that they will withdraw their armies if we make peace with Greece, but not until then.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32485;We conquered Athens once and we shall do so again.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32484;A Stifling of Hellenism;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32484;Through our intense efforts to quash the movement for Greek Independence, we have managed to successfully track down and execute nearly all the central figures in the movement. While Greek nationalism will likely never truly end, we have at least made it far less potent.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32484;A more peaceful time awaits.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32483;Our Ancient Military;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32483;By the Victorian Era, the military of the Ottoman Empire was extremely outdated. Though alliances with European Powers had helped somewhat, as had the abolition of the Janissaries in 1826, the Empire's capabilities were far behind those of the Christian Powers. Until we launch upon a large modernization effort, our military will suffer in comparison to those of the Christians.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32483;Outdated? This is the same force that conquered the Romans!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32482;Repulsed from Crimea;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32482;We have failed to keep the Crimean Peninsula in the hands of our allies, and we must now pay the price for it. Our claims to the lands surrounding the Black Sea have lost all legitimacy in the eyes of the world.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32482;Who needs the Tartars anyway?;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32470;Murat the Mad;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32470;Though the current King of Naples, Joachim Murat the First, was put on the throne by Napoleon, Murat chose to rebel against France in the Great War of 1822 in a bid for independence. Since then, he has grown progressively madder and more paranoid, reinstating absolutism and imprisoning or killing any who disagree with him. On the positive side, his vast collection of self-awarded medallions has aided the crafting industry significantly.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32470;All hail our beloved leader! Or else.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA37241;We are free!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME37243;German War of Liberation;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37243;The Coalition of Nations engages in a war with the French with hopes of gaining their freedom. We have waited for the French to fall into a period of weakness, and this is the perfect chance!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA37243;The German War of Liberation begins!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB37243;Perhaps this is too risky.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37245;We have defeated the French, and gained the freedom of many new German states who will look to join our country. Germany shall rule Europe forever!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME66550;British Diplomacy;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66550;The British Empire has approached our diplomats with the proposal to negotiate over our claims to our former colonies in the Atlantic. While we may not like the Imperials, they may offer us a good deal.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66550;We shall hear their offer.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB66550;We shall not negotiate with oligarchical scum!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66551;Choosing Our Offer;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66551;The French have proven willing to negotiate. We can generously give them back their colonies, which will surely improve relations between our nations greatly, or we can attempt to purchase the rights to their lands and get them to drop their claims. They may not be as likely to accept the second offer, though.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66551;Let us give back their colonies and bind our nations together in friendship.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB66551;Would 100,000 pounds be enough?;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66552;French Rejection;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66552;Sadly, the French have been insulted by our offer and refuse to negotiate. Our relations have suffered as a result.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME66553;A Generous Offer;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME66554;A Tempting Offer;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;n
EVTDESC66554;Unfortunately, the British Empire refuses to consider letting us have our colonies back. However, they are willing to compensate us generously if we agree to drop our claims to the islands.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66554;Better that we be paid in gold than we pay them in blood.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB66554;We will not sell our nation's honor for money!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66556;The French Accept;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66556;The French have agreed to sell us the claims to the colonies. Our bankers are getting ready to process the transaction, and our diplomats are celebrating a possible aversion of war.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66556;I guess one can deal with these people.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66557;The French Refuse;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66557;Sadly, the French have not taken our offer of compensation well at all, and have considered it an insult. It looks as though we shall have to prepare for eventual war.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME86000;The Rise of Nations;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86000;Won over by the promises of the enemy, the non-French peoples of our Empire have risen against us and joined in a common confederation devoted to securing our defeat and gaining independence.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86000;We shall crush them too!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86001;The End of the Coalition;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86001;Our nation has successfully retained its imperium over its non-French populations. The morale of the nationalist movements is shattered, and any hopes that their coalition will rise again in the future have been dashed.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME86003;The Coalition Victory;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86003;The Coalition of Nations has fulfilled their obligations in the French Civil War, and have now been given the freedom we so desire.

EVTOPTA86003;We raise a glass to our new freedom!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86029;Our Weary People;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86029;Our country can no longer fight, not because we have been defeated, but because we cannot handle any more violence. The continuation of this war benefits none other than our enemies who pounce on our weakness. We surrender with hopes France can stand strong once more.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME86080;The Greek War of Independence;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86080;Emboldened by the funding from the Christian powers, the Greek subjects of the sultan have risen in rebellion against us. Though on their own they are weak, it is quite possible that powerful nations awash with romatic ideas of a free Greece will intervene to aid them if we do not put this rebellion down quickly. If a foreign power does interced, than making a peace with Greece will thus lead to us losing our claim to the land.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86080;Filthy Swine.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86081;Greek Independence;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86081;Today word has reached us that the Ottoman Empire has agreed to release a good deal of Greek territory as a free Greek state. This is a glorious day for both the Greeks and for those who admire Greek culture, and our nation's sucessful intervention gives some of today's glory to us.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86081;Long live free Greece!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86082;Greek Independence;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86082;The combined pressure of the Greek rebels and the Christian Powers has forced us to agree to the establishment of a free Greek state.

EVTNAME600025;The Hungarian Menace;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600025;While Hungary has long been under the rule of the Hapsburgs, the lack of threat from the Turks have led many Hungarians to begin pushing for greater independence for their nation. While the situation is under control for now, our spies in the Hungarian nationalist movements report that if concessions are not made to Hungary within a few years, the Hungarians will likely revolt against us if our nation has become vulnerable from having a War Exhaustion score of 30 or higher.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600025;Perhaps we should consider a compromise.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600026;The Hungarian Revolution;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600026;It seems our unwillingness to compromise with the Hungarians in our empire may have been a mistake.

EVTOPTA600026;We will crush them!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600027;The Claim to Spain;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600027;When Napoleon invaded Spain and put his brother on the throne, few accepted him as the legitimate king. However, the true heir and his family were kept imprisoned by Napoleon until they died childless. As a result, the closest living relative happens to be the King of Sicily, due to a claim from Charles III of Spain. A delegation from the King has arrived today, demanding we recognize his claim to the throne and unite with Sicily as one nation. This seems like it might be the right time to restore the monarchy, but factions in the Cortes are divided. Some say we should offer him the crown on his own terms, while some say we should demand he rule constitutionally. Some radicals even claim we should refuse to submit to a European monarch.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600027;He is our rightful sovereign.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC600028;The silly liberals in the Cortes have thrown away their principles in their desparation for a rightful king. Though our accession to the throne is technically in violation of the Treaty of Utrecht, few in Europe other than France care anymore about such relics.

EVTDESC600029;The liberals in the Cortes have shown willingness to make us King of Spain, but at a cost. If we wish to rule them, we must agree to accept a constitution for Spain.

EVTNAME600031;The Royal Rejection;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600031;It seems that for some, despotism is more valuable than legitimacy. The King of Sicily has refused our offer, and has decided to continue ruling as an absolute monarch.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC600038;Under our tutelage, the Native Confederation has grown over the decades to the point that they can no longer be considered any more backwards than the West. Today they have announced their equality to the world, which also reflects well on our drive to civilize the backwards peoples of the world.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600038;Hurrah!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600039;Imperial Experts;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600039;As a dominion of the British Empire, our people both suffer and benefit from our puppet status. Though we are not free to form our own foreign policy, the Imperial government takes an interest in our welfare, and often sends experts to help us modernize our technology so we can better combat those who would take our land.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600039;"What is this ""wheel"" they keep talking about?";;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600040;The Capital, Occupied;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600040;The enemy has occuped our capital. The effects of this cannot be understated, as all over our nation, the populace is panicking. Rebel groups seeing a chance to overthrow the government are forming, families are fleeing wherever they can go to get away from the enemy, the infrastructure of the nation is shutting down, and calls for peace at any price grow louder each day. Until we retake our capital, the chances of this war ending well look grim.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600040;We must continue the fight!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600041;The Capital, Taken;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600041;The enemy no longer controls our capital. The people are calming down, and life is returning to some state of normalcy-- at least, whatever can be called normal in a time of hardship.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600041;Our sacred soil is ours once more.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600045;The Liberal Pope?;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600045;In an event that has shocked Europe, the Papal Conclave of 1846 has elected Giovanni Maria Mastai-Ferretti, a man widely believed to be a liberal and an Italian nationalist, as the new Pope. Taking the name Pope Pius IX, many in Italy see him as the possible head of a unified Italy. In the next few years, many Italian nationalists will look towards the Papal State to see if Pius really represents the spirit of reform Italy needs.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600045;Pius IX is indeed a reformer.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB600045;Pius IX is more interested in spiritual matters.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600046;The Work of Redemption;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600046;Giuseppe Garibaldi, a general famous both for his skill in waging war in South America and for his radical Italian nationalism, has today shown up at the Papal Palace. Apparently seeing in Pius IX the figure of the man who will unify Italy in a Work of Redemption, he has offered to put himself at the head of an effort to conquer Italy under the Pope's rule through the raising of voluntary militias. Accepting could mean control over Italy, but it would also completely alienate us from the other Italian states.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600046;For the Church and the Fatherland!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB600046;This man seems a bit mad.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME600052;The New Republic;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600052;We are hearing whispers that Garibaldi has conquered an Italian state. Let us see and wait what comes of this.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600052;Horrid.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600054;A Present for Pius;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600054;Garibaldi was not all talk, it seems. One of the Italian nations has today fallen to his forces, and he has declared its immediate unification with us under the new national state of Italy.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600054;Upon this Rock we shall build a nation!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600056;Building the Nation;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600056;Garibaldi's forces have today conquered another state, and it has been put under Italian control.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600056;God bless the man.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600057;The End of Italy;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600057;The experiment of liberalism and nationalism that was the state of Italy has today ended. No longer will anyone question the right of the existing Italian states to maintain their independence.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600057;Don't bother me with such petty news.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600063;The Rise of the Redshirts;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600063;Due to a recent liberal and nationalist surge that has occured throughout Europe, many Italians are increasingly seeing the current division of the Italian peninsula as a violation of the common ties of the Italian people, and the diverse Italian states as illegitimate. Such sentiments have lead to cries for a united and liberal Italy, and taking advantage of this situation, the famed freedom fighter Giuseppe Garibaldi has landed from exile in Italy. He is calling upon Italians to rise up against their government and estabish a united Italian nation, and is forming a militia of Redshirts to accomplish this. While a small state taken by him will likely simply lose its monarchy, if we find ourselves in a position of being a great power, we stand a chance at influencing Garibaldi to let us be the ones to lead this Risorgimento.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600063;Blasted liberals.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600069;Repubblica del Popolo;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600069;Garibaldi, acting as dictator for the provisional government, has determined that our nation is ripe for permanent republicanism. However, this is merely on a provisional basis, and if a larger state takes on the mantle of Italy, we will forcibly be inherited by them.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600069;This is a humiliation!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600070;Italia del Popolo;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600070;Garibaldi, acting as dictator for the provisional government, has determined that our state is powerful enough to potentially unify the Italian peninsula and create, not an Italy of Caesars or of Popes, but an Italy of the People. As such, our new republic must now lead the fight against the other Italian states, who will surely wish to destroy us.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600070;Long live the Italian people!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600071;Garibaldi Takes Action;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600071;One of the Italian states has today fallen before the forces of Garibaldi and his voluntary militia of redshirts, and has been incorporated into his plans to forcibly unite Italy. We must prepare to fight against these forces and all their sympathizers.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600071;May nationalism by damned!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600072;Shackled to Italy;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600072;Garibaldi, acting as dictator for the provisional government, has determined that our nation is to be linked to the newly formed Italian state. Our time as a free state is at an end.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600072;I don't want to be an Italian!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600073;Long Live Italy;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600073;Because of our dominant position on the Italian peninsula, Garibaldi, though a committed republican, has swallowed his pride for the sake of a united Italy and has appeared before us today, offering us his recent conquest and the mantle of the Kingdom of Italy. Crowds of tens of thousands have escorted him here, and throughout our nation, the cries of millions echo to God as our people praise the birth of a united Italy.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600073;Long live Italy!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB600073;I'll just take the land, thanks.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600075;Italy Grows Larger;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600075;Thanks to Garibaldi's Redshirts, our nation has absorbed another of his conquests today, adding it to our holdings and increasing the size of the new Italy.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME600076;The Italy of the Popes;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600076;All over Italy, millions of joyous Italians are hearing of our quest to unify Italy, and are praising the name of God and the Pope. Many are planning to join Garibaldi and rise against their state in the hopes of joining our holy nation.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC600078;All over Italy, millions of terrified Italians are hearing of our quest to unify Italy, and are cautiously praising the name of Murat the Mad while looking over their shoulders, as if someone is watching them. Many are planning to join Garibaldi and rise against their state, many simply because they fear the consequences of not doing so.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME600079;Italy, the Historical Nation;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600079;All over Italy, millions of joyous Italians are hearing of our quest to unify Italy, and are praising the name of Sicily and of God. Many are planning to join Garibaldi and rise against their state in the hopes of joining our illustrious nation.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME600080;Italy, the Baffling Nation;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600080;All over Italy, millions of confused Italians are hearing of our quest to unify Italy, and are wondering aloud how on earth a nation that was so small a few decades ago is now the dominant Italian power. Many are planning to join Garibaldi and rise against their state in the hopes of joining us, though most of them are only doing so after getting horribly drunk and doing it as a bet.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600080;We are NOT too pussy to join the Redshirts, man.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600081;Italy, the Nation;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA600081;Italy shall be ruled by true Italians!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600083;Garibaldi's Call;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600083;After failing to fully unite the Italian peninsula around the midpoint of the century, Italian pan-nationalism lost some its allure, and few redshirts were to be seen. Now, however, a new generation of young men are again embracing the concept of a unified Italy, an Garibaldi has once more come into prominence, promising to once more recruit his voluntary militias to finally unify the Italian people.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600083;What a troublemaker.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55000;The Frankfurt Assembly;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55000;Admist the tide of liberal sentiment that has been unleashed upon the German states, calls by liberals for a unification of the German people have become especially prevalent. Huge demonstrations of pan-nationalists and a positive tone towards this action by the press occur almost daily, and it is feared that, whether the rulers of the German states like it or not, some sort of unification will be forced by the people. In response to this outpouring of support, an Assembly in Frankfurt has formed, made up of liberals dedicated to a unified Germany, and calls are being issued to all the nations to send delegates to agree to a common union.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55000;What a headache.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55001;The Federation of the Rhine;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55001;Enough states have sent delegations to Frankfurt to correctly say that a majority of the princes of the Confederation of the Rhine are in favor of unification. Thankfully, one of the Rhine states has recently emerged as the greatest among us, and as a first nation amongst equals, its ruler shall be offered the hereditary Presidency of the United Federation of the Rhine.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55001;Deutschland ?er alles!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55002;The Federation of the Rhine;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55002;The Frankfurt Assembly has sent a delegation to us today. Apparently, more than half of the Confederation states have decided to support the unification of the German peoples, and as the predominant power amongst the Rhine states, the Assembly has offered us the hereditary office of the Presidency of the United Federation of the Rhine. While accepting this would mean satisfying the liberal elements within our nation, along with considerable enlargement of our territory, many conservatives feel that the position they offer, and the liberal political constitution of the proposed state, is an illegitimate office, offered not by the grace of God, but by the liberal and unholy sentiments of modernity.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55002;Deutschland ?er alles!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB55002;Smells like a gutter in here.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55003;The Federation of the Rhine;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55003;Enough states have sent delegations to Frankfurt to correctly say that a majority of the princes of the Confederation of the Rhine are in favor of unification. Unfortunately, none of the Rhine states are currently prominent enough to be the obvious choice to lead a common union. As such, the Assembly has decided to offer the hereditary position of Presidency of the United Federation of the Rhine to one of the German states outside of the Confederation.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55003;Deutschland ?er alles!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55004;The Federation of the Rhine;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55004;Recent pan-nationalist sentiments in the Confederation of the Rhine have led to an Assembly of delegates from the various German states that claim a majority of the princes of the Confederation of the Rhine are in favor of unification. Because none of the Rhine states are currently powerful enough to lead such a common union, the assembly has sent a delegation to us requesting that we take the hereditary position of President and Protector of the Independent and United Federation of the Rhine. While accepting this would mean satisfying the liberal elements within our nation, along with considerable enlargement of our influence in Germany, many conservatives feel that the position they offer is an illegitimate office, offered not by the grace of God, but by the liberal and unholy sentiments of modernity.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55004;Deutschland ?er alles!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB55004;Smells like a gutter in here.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55005;Joining the Federation;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55005;The efforts of the Frankfurt Assembly have led to the creation of a union of the Rhine states under a heriditary President. While we did not support this venture, many in our nation, now having seen a union of the German people actually form, are now pushing strongly for us to join them. Doing so, of course, would mean an end to our sovereignty.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55005;Deutschland ?er alles!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB55005;We have no desire to join such a patchwork state.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55007;The Failure of Frankfurt;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55007;Just as the liberal sentiments of the Springtime of Nations has failed to produce any significant effect on our political system, so has the Frankfurt Assembly failed to unify the German people. Embarassed and despairing, the delegates to the Assembly are now slinking quietly back to their homes with their tails between their legs.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55007;Serves them right.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55008;The National Awakening;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55008;Due to the failure of the Turks to keep the angry and nationalistic Greek people within their empire, and viewing the restlessness of many of the Romanian nobles, the sultan of the Ottoman Empire has today extended the privelege of electoral election of a prince to Wallachia and Moldavia. People in both states are today celebrating their partial liberation from Trukish despotism, and are increasingly seeing themselves, not as subjects of others, but as fellow Romanians with a common heritage and culture.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55008;Long live the Romanian people!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55009;The Personal Union;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55009;Due to increasing Romanian nationalism, the nobilities of Wallachia and Moldavia have decided that they must be seperate states no longer. As such, today they have elected a common Domnitor to rule over both nations, and the two provinces have come together as one nation.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55009;Long live Romania!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55010;Das Kaiserthum Oesterreich;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55010;The Austrian Empire, after having escaped with the least damage of any great power in Europe after the Napoleonic Wars, seems a bastion of strength to the outside world. To the west, Italy and the Confederation of the Rhine are no longer French puppets, and in Eastern Europe, Prussia and Russia have been serverely weakened by war and civil disorder, while the reborn Polish nation has yet to make a mark on the world. Yet within its huge borders, the Empire is faced with many obstacles to overcome. The current Emperor, Ferdinand I, is mentally and physically impaired, and the Empire is really ruled by a council of arch-conservatives who oppose all efforts at reform. The huge number of minorities within the empire, many of whom resent our rule and are beginning to awaken to their national identities, spells even further trouble. While we currently follow the policies of Germanization and centralization established by Franz I, a time may soon come where a change might be preferable.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55010;The Empire will always be German.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55011;The Nymph of the Dniester;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55011;In 1836, a group of Ruthenians published The Nymph of the Dniester, a collection of folk songs and stories published in the long-neglected Ruthenian language. The Austrian government quickly realized the threat of nationalism this might provoke, and banned the book.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55011;Bloody peasants.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55012;The Polish Uprising;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55012;Our spies in the Polish provinces of Galicia inform us that the Polish nobility there is attempting to stir up popular support for an uprising against us amongst the peasants, with the goal of joining the Polish-Lithuanian nation. The nobility is quite unpopular amongst the Polish peasants there, due to their harsh, serf-like treatment, and we might be able cut the problem off at the roots by funding an anti-nobility counterrevolution. Doing so, however, could lead to the peasantry realizing its power, and some say we should teach the Poles a lesson they will never forget.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55012;A Gulden for every noble head!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB55012;We'll show the Poles who is in charge.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55013;The Polish Uprising;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55013;News has reached us that an anti-Hapsburg revolt has occured in the Polish provinces of the Empire. The rebels have come to us to petition us to aid them in their stuggle, with the goal of reuniting whit our nation. We could go to war with Austria to save the rebellion, but doing so would alienate us from every surrounding power.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55013;To arms!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB55013;We cannot risk alienating our neighbors.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55014;The Polish Intervention;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55014;The Polish nation has issued an official declaration of war against us in an attempt to aid the Galician rebels and take the provinces for their own nation.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55014;We will crush every Pole that comes against us!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55015;Poland Triumphant;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55015;The war with Austria is over, our Polish brethern successfully stealing away the Galician provinces from Austria. Our armies march through the Galician capital of Lvov, cheered on by the Polish citizens, and their nobility has officially turned over their arms and sovereignty to us.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55015;Long live Poland-Lithuania!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55017;Resignation of Metternich;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55017;The wave of liberalism that is sweeping across Europe has hit us quite hard. Liberals in the near-powerless Diet have become increasingly vocal, and have demanded the resignation of Prince Klemens von Metternich, the arch-conservative who is widely believed to be the real ruler of the Empire. Realizing the danger he is in from increasinlgy loud and violent crowds in Vienna, he has resigned and fled the country.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55017;How will we run the country now?;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55018;The Vienna Baricades;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55018;The resignation of Metternich has only whetted the apettite of liberals in the capital, and news has reached us that rebels are taking to the streets and constructing barricades, threatening violence if the government does not embrace liberalism and constitutionalism.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55018;Quick, promise reforms!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB55018;We will not bow to the will of a mob.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55019;Franz Joseph I;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55019;The army has remained loyal to the crown, and has crushed the liberal uprising in Vienna with ease. Yet the generals of the Empire, who have been the real rulers throughout the last few months of chaos, have demanded a more stable regime to preserve the status quo. As such, the mentally unsound Emperor Ferdinand has abdicated in favor of the young Franz Joseph, who today takes the throne as Emperor Franz Joseph I, who is not bound by the promises of concessions made to the rebels.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55019;Gott erhalte Franz Joseph!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55020;The Pan-Slav Congress;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55020;In response to the German nationalism that has become so common amongst the liberals in Vienna, and due to our weakened grip over our Empire, our Czech subjects in the Kingdom of Bohemia have organized a Congress where all the Slavic peoples of Europe have gathered to discuss their common culture and plights. Nearly all of the Czechs are calling for some greater form of autonomy for Bohemia, with some calling for complete equality with the Austrian lands, and some of the radicals even calling for complete independence from the Empire.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55020;Czechs are supposed to pretend to be German!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55021;A Kingdom of Hungary?;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55021;Since the Hapsburgs inherited the Austrian throne centuries ago, many Hungarians have sought greater autonomy for their land, which the Austrians have been reluctant to grant. Since the end of the Napoleonic Wars, this desires has gotten increasingly stronger, and taking advantage of our weakened state, a group of Hungarians led by Lajos Kossuth has declared their intention to form an autonomous Hungarian nation with Franz Joseph to be elected as their nominal king. However, realizing this may mean civil war in the Empire, the Hungarians have presented a proposal to our government to abandon our policy of Germanization and stablize the Empire by dividing it between Austria and Hungary, who will work together as equals and fight under the same banner. While this polic is anathema to the arch-conservatives and the German nationalism of the liberals in Vienna, it is certain that refusing this offer will require us to use force to keep Hungary.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55021;Dualism is the way to go.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB55021;The Empire shall remain whole!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55022;The Kingdom of Hungary;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55022;It is a black day for the Empire. Our armies have been defeated by those of Hungary, and the peace terms dicated by them require us to cede all of the Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen to them, including those that remained loyal to us in the fight. On the bright side, however, Hungary has remained a monarchy, and the nobility has elected Franz Joeph as the de jure King of Hungary. Regardless, it will take time to recover from this blow.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55022;Awful.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55023;Reincorporating Hungary;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55023;Now that we have wisely re-embraced the policy of centralization and Germanization of our Empire, the delicate situation of Hungary, until now our partner in Imperial affairs, remains to be solved. While most of the conservative members of the government are advocating direct reincorporation, even if this may mean armed resistance from the Hungarians. However, some of the liberal, pan-German members at court are insisting that we should let the Magyars go in peace, and that our destiny lies in the West, not the East.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55023;Let them go in peace.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME55026;A Galician Diet?;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55026;While tensions with the primarily Polish and Ruthenian provinces of Galicia have always existed, after the failure of the attempted revolt against us 10 years ago, many of the Polish aristocracy in the region have moderated their demands. Today they have come to us hombly, putting forth a proposal of establishing a local Diet that will give them some autonomy from the Imperial government. Many in our government have responded positively to this proposal, alleging that it will greatly stabilize the region and allow us to focus on more pressing matters, and adopting this plan might be the first step in establishing a policy of Federalism and local rule throughout the Empire.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55026;This sounds like an excellent idea!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC55027;"With instability in the Empire growing, both from the ethnic minorities within our nation and the liberal elements in Vienna, many have insisted that Austria needs some form of constitution to steer its course. One such idea that is being proposed is the so-called ""February Patent,"" which would greatly strengthen the Imperial Diet. However, since the national Diet is made up of primarily German-speaking subjects, the policy would necessarily involve a great weakening of all the local diets of the minorities throughout the Empire. Precisely for these centalizing tendencies, many of the liberals in our government are supporting it, while minority delegations are furiously protesting its adoption.";;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC55040;With instability in the Empire growing as the minorities within our empire continue to fall sway to the siren song of nationalism, the Hungarian nobles of the Empire have today presented us with a proposal that they claim will solve our worries. Allowing Hungary independence from Hungary save for military and foreign affairs and letting each side of the compromise deal with their barbarians in their own way, they claim, will ensure that Austria remains stable for centuries to come. Of course, many in the government claim that Hungary should not have a special role in the state, but should be offered the autonomy they deserve in line with our federalist policies.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

The recent elections for the Bohemian Diet confirm this, as for the first time ever, the majority of elected members are not German, but Czech. While they are divided between radicals and conservatives, all Czechs are pushing for a greater amount of autonomy within the Empire, if not outright independence.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC55085;Due to the Empire's recent losses of much of its non-German territories, a new force has emerged in Austrian politics. Calling themselves the Pan-Germans, groups of young and idealistic Austrians are preaching a gospel of nationalism and racialism, claiming that we must embrace our Germanic heritage and fully repudiate the concept of Austria rule over the East. Only once we unify with the other Germanic states, they say, will Austria truly fulfil its destiny.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

A favourable agreement appears to have come within our grasp which would split the Columbia District along the south of the Columbia River and end most disputes over the territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44156OPTA;All's well that ends well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44156OPTB;The British Empire will retain Columbia in its entirety!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44157;The British Cession;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44157;Representatives from the British Empire have offered the United States lands south of the 49th parallel and some lands near the Minnesota Territory as a trade for the lands north of the 49th parallel owned by the United States. The land trade would resolve many longstanding issues with the definitions of the American border with the Empire, but given the history the United States has with the Empire, is it necessary?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44157OPTA;The frontier will look nicer;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44157OPTB;We do not negotiate with filthy monarchists!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44158;The Extension of the Oregon Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44158;Now that the definition of the Oregon Territory has been set in stone, many in the American government are clamoring for an extension of the treaty to handle longstanding issues with the 49th parallel with regards to the American-Empire border.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44158OPTA;Move forward with the request;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44158OPTB;No extension is necessary;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44159;American Extension of the Oregon Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44159;Delegates from the United States have come over to seek a decision over the Empire-American border. With the borders of Columbia set in stone, it may be worth simplifying the borders we share with the Americans in the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME36898;The Ascension of Queen Victoria;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC36898;Today, in the year of our Lord $YEAR$, William the Fourth, by the Grace of God, King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, died in Toronto. As he had no living legitimate children, Princess Victoria of Kent, William's niece, found herself ruling one of the Great Powers and the biggest colonial empire in the World. Her coronation is scheduled for the 28th of June, 1838, when princess Alexandrina Victoria of House Hanover will officially ascend to the throne of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland as 'Queen Victoria'. Her reign, which would last even a few years into the 20th century, would later be remembered as a period of turmoil for the British Empire, battling with the British Republicans. Today a jubilant crowd has escorted the young Queen Victoria to her residence in the possibly temporary capital of the British Empire, Bytown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME44160;Fugitive Slave Crisis of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44160;Slaves from Maryland have escaped over to neighboring Pennsylvania over in New England. The owners of the slaves had sent a hunting party and gone themselves as well to regain their slaves. After crossing the border into nearby Philadelphia, they engaged with the nearby police forces in a standoff. With the police refusing to let the slave owners search the city for their slaves, the situation became chilly. Nobody knows who fired the first shot, but it left five policemen, three from the hunting party, and the slave owner dead. When news broke in the United States, there were near-riots in Atlanta and demands for retribution on the New Englanders. With the situation destabilizing, the United States government has formulated an ultimatum, demanding the return of all fugitive slaves in New England, and the presence of the United States Army in Pennsylvania to ensure transit of all slaves. This can, and likely will mean war between the two countries, but not much can be done about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44160OPTA;Send the ultimatum!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44161OPTA;Then Maryland will just become ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44162;Fugitive Slave War in New England;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44162;The war in New England has reached a boiling point with the war drawing ever closer near British borders. Many in the government are fearful that in the event of an American victory, there will be a new war in the future to overtake Canada as revenge for the earlier American humiliation in 1814. Envoys from New England have offered to make New England subordinate to the Empire, with the added benefit of the transfer of Maine to the Empire if the Empire intervenes and sucessfully defends New England from the Dixie hordes. This will certainly bring us to war with the United States, but perhaps this is a war of necessity when put in scope of the far greater conflict with the British Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44162OPTA;We must protect our allies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44162OPTB;We are not their babysitters!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVT44163OPTA;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44164;The United States have been repelled and our agreement with the New Englanders will be upheld!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
